      <description>My Houdini, the blue layer pictured in these photos, is no more. After 6 years together our paternship came to a sudden end. I was in disbelief. It wasn&amp;#8217;t due to some epic alpine adventure. It was caused by a puppy; a cute, energetic, teething puppy.

      <description>Update: 2019-08-10: Fixed rerun directive in build.rs
Tree-sitter is a parser generator tool and parsing library. It generates portable parsers that can be used in several languages including Rust. Tree-sitter grammars are available for several languages.
This is a game changer because it lowers the barrier to entry for writing language tooling. You no longer need to write your own parser. With Tree-sitter, you can now simply use an existing parser.</description>
